It\'s important to understand that the goal of this course is not to conduct research or to learn research methods, but rather to focus on the software engineering aspects of developing these systems. Your technical contribution and creativity will come from applying your problem-solving skills and technical creativity to build these significant software systems. To emulate industry experiences, research leads from the HCI Lab will act as external stakeholders, providing feedback and navigating requirements, much like clients in a professional setting. See projects section for information on project details, topics, and stakeholders. These projects are chosen to be \\"resume-worthy\\" and will give you hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle, preparing you for the industry. You are encouraged to be flexible with programming languages and technologies such as JavaScript, Python, React, Next.js, and Docker, choosing what best fits your project rather than sticking to familiar languages if they are not the optimal choice.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"schedule":{"id":"schedule","title":"Weekly Schedule","description":"Lectures will be held on Wednesdays, while Mondays and Fridays will be reserved for stakeholder meetings and project work.
