## Course Description

This course is designated as a capstone course by CIS department. By its very nature, it is a method of summative evaluation of students' learned knowledge in computer science. It allows an instructor to assess the student’s overall academic learning experience and its application to software project development. It provides an environment and atmospheric in which students run team-oriented design and implementation of large programming projects. Students will propose topics for review and acceptance early in the semester. Students will provide written documentation of their proposed projects and will demonstrate the operation of their completed projects in oral presentations and demonstrations. General agile-based industrial-standard project management processes for software development will be applied to project development in all phases.
This is a pure “project-driven” course and students work on their assignments in a project
team. Project-driven learning is known as active learning in which in-depth classroom projects are organized to facilitate learning and assess student competence. This means that students will spend a lot of lab time in lab and collaborate with other team members during the project development phases. It is believed that learning takes place best within the context of problems to be solved and questions that are raised. We expect students to provide the solutions to problems arising during the project development, both technically and managerially.
This course is identified as a Writing-Intensive Course in CIS. You are expected to learn about writing relevant technical software design and development documents along the course of your project development and generate all the documents and their revisions in the entire duration of the course.

### Education Goal
The design of this capstone course is to provide senior students in computer science major with a typical industrial working environment in which students will undergo all the project development phases and gain the experience of project development practices. Students apply all the knowledge they learned in their previous years in college and acquire new knowledge and skills needed to complete their projects. At the end of class, students are able to reach the goal of learning to work - making transition from school to work. Project will be proposed, documented, developed and tested step by step. Students working in teams must deliver deliverables in accordance with requirements on schedule within resource restriction. Students are expected to improve their project management, communication and team working skills in all the development phases.

### Learning Objectives

- Learn and improve technical writing skill - Writing-Intensive
- Practice active learning - project driven
- Coordinate working in team and improve communication skill

### Labs 

When you register for this course, you are mainly registering for the lab session for this course.  
You are expected to spend more time in lab than in lecture. Students are REQUIRED to attend 
the lab section that they are registered for.  Attendance will count as part of your grade. Random 
attendance record will be checked in both labs and lectures. 
 
The labs are designed for team members to work together and to communicate each other in a 
group. Successful project development relies on a teamwork environment in which team 
members must collaborate and communicate. 
 
### Project  

You will undergo all the project development phases and experience the project development 
practice in a typical industrial working environment. Project will be proposed, documented, 
developed, and tested step by step. The final goals of a project are to deliver deliverables in 
accordance with requirements on schedule within resource restriction. You are expected to 
improve your project management and team working skills in all the development phases.  
 
Students will be organized into project teams ranging in size from 5 to 7. The project will follow 
a modified version of the Rational Unified Process known as the Unified Process for Education.  

Students will propose their project ideas at the start of the second week of class. Project ideas must be substantial enough to be completed by 
a team of 5 - 7 students. 

:::tip Project Categories

- Mobile Applications
- Progressive Web Applications
- Embedded Systems 
- Machine Learning
- RESTFul APIs 
- Message Bot Integrations
- *Multiplayer* Games

Ultimatly **be creative and passionate**. Some projects may not fit the above categories, and that is okay as long as the idea is well thought out, and researched.
:::

### Project Management Process 

Agile-based software development project management process and the deployment of its tools 
will be introduced in the class. An agile is a very empowering process that helps software 
companies design and build the right products. The management process is very beneficial for 
software companies because it helps them analyze and improve their products throughout its 
development. Agile is a process that helps teams provide quick and unpredictable responses to 
the feedback they receive on their projects. It creates opportunities to assess a project’s direction 
during the development cycle. Teams assess the project progresses in regular meetings called 
sprints or iterations. 
 
### Documentation 

You are expected to develop your documentation using a project documentation tool called 
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs). Docusaurus will help you create and maintain a 
documentation website for all of your project documents. They will be written in markdown 
format. These, then, are easily published to GitHub Pages (for references on the markdown 
format we recommend this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). We will 
provide templates and tutorials on how to generate and revise your documents. These should be 
followed to receive a grade on your documentation assignments.  
 
You will open a pull request on GitHub, marking Instructors as reviewers, and turn in a link to 
your project documents on-line to the Canvas Web site. The instructors will directly comment on 
your documentation site's GitHub repository, but you will receive your grade through Canvas. 
These documents will be continuously revised over the course of the semester in this manner.

### Quizzes and Exams
There will be no mid-term and final exams given for this capstone course. Several milestone project demos and one final project presentations and demo during the semester will be made in lieu of mid-term and final exams. Several quizzes in the format of Zoom Polling may be given as we move forward to project development phases.

### Grading
- 10% Project Proposal
- 40% Project Documents
- 10% Project Management Process
- 30% Project Presentation, Demos and Deliverables
- 10% Attendance and Participation


:::warning **THIS IS A WRITING INTENSIVE COURSE.**
 As a university policy on a writing-intensive course, at least 40% weight will be weighed to the final score in Canvas based on the writing assignments. You will submit all the project documentation and project status reports as writing assignments to the Canvas and the work will be graded based on technical content and quality of writing.
:::

There will be two kinds of assignments in this course: group and individual assignments. As a result, your final grading will mainly be dependent on both group performance and your personal performance. First, a project will get a grade based on the group performance. This project grade will be used as a base grade for all the students working in the same project group. Then each student’s grade is adjusted either up or down based on the student’s personal performance in the project and the scores in Canvas.

:::tip How do you score an A?

<Figure src={grading} alt={"The function G(g) set equal to the scale from C+ to A- Ascending on the Y axis. On the X axis are 7 squares representing students, with the second square appearing higher on the y-axis to represent the score of A-. Attached to the afformentioned second square is a curly brace with a delta function with p as an argument to represent performance. on the rightmost side of the image are four male and female stick figures."} caption={"Grading Individual and Group Performance Scale."}
        subcaption={`g = Group performance,
    p = Personal performance,  Final grade = G(g) + Δ(p)`}
/>

A project gets a group grade B based on the group performance, almost all of the team members in the project team will get B grades except a few team members may get better or poorer grades than B based on their personal performance. Therefore, it is important to contribute, and be a team player.

:::

:::caution Canvas grades are only used as reference
As a result of this grading policy the scores in Canvas will only be used as a reference for providing final grades.
:::


The group performance is evaluated in the following three measurements:
- deliverables meeting requirements,
- complexity of project
- teamwork

The personal performance is evaluated in the following three measurements:
- initiative
- contribution
- attitude

### Course Orientation

This is a pure “project-driven” course and you work on your assignment in a project in a team. This means that you will spend a lot of lab time in lab and collaborate with other team members during the project development phases. It seems as though learning takes place best within the context of problems to be solved and questions that are raised. We expect you to provide the solutions to problems arising during the project development, both technically and managerially.

### Course Schedule

There are 16 weeks in the semester. The project schedule is managed in three phases as follows:

- Inception (2 weeks): decide what you do
- Elaboration (4 weeks): say how you will do it
- Construction (10 weeks): do what you say in elaboration. Or to quote Nike "Just Do It."

There will be three milestone and one final presentations/demos. All milestone demos are scheduled in the Construction phase and the final demo at the end of the semester. A detailed class schedule is shown below.

:::important Some Activities are subject to change
As instructor I reserve the right to change activities if necessary, however **Milestone demo dates will not change** during the duration of the course.
