# Course Syllabus

## Course Summary

Welcome to CIS 4398 Capstone Projects in Computer Science, your final course for the Computer Science Major! This course is designed to be the **culmination of your academic journey**, where you'll utilize all your previous coursework and outside experience **to build software as a team**. Our course motto, **"Don't Panic"**, is a reminder to embrace the unique challenges of this **purely project-driven and team-based environment**. It aims to prepare you for **real-world industry experiences** and provide a **tangible project to showcase on your resume**. You'll engage in an **agile software development environment** that's **user-focused, goal-driven, process-oriented, and emphasizes teamwork**. You will use industry-standard tools like **Jira software** for project management, planning, and estimating workload, **Docusaurus** for maintaining robust project documentation (a writing-intensive component making up 40% of your grade), and **GitHub** for managing code contributions, pull requests, and peer reviews, fostering heavy collaboration among team members.

<img src="/img/temple_hci_lab_logo.jpeg" style={{float:"right", marginLeft:"15px", marginBottom:"5px", maxWidth:"300px"}} alt="Temple University Human-Computer Interaction Lab"/>

This semester, you'll experience an **authentic capstone project** by integrating **real-world research problems** from the Temple University Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab, moving beyond traditionally self-chosen projects. It's important to understand that the **goal of this course is not to conduct research or to learn research methods, but rather to focus on the software engineering aspects** of developing these systems. Your technical contribution and creativity will come from applying your **problem-solving skills and technical creativity to build these significant software systems**. To emulate industry experiences, **research leads from the HCI Lab will act as external stakeholders**, providing feedback and navigating requirements, much like clients in a professional setting. See [projects](#projects) section for information on project details, topics, and stakeholders. These projects are chosen to be "resume-worthy" and will give you **hands-on experience** in the software development lifecycle, preparing you for the industry. You are encouraged to be **flexible with programming languages and technologies** such as JavaScript, Python, React, Next.js, and Docker, choosing what best fits your project rather than sticking to familiar languages if they are not the optimal choice.

### What You Will Learn

- **Hands-On Experience**: Work in an environment that mirrors professional software development.
- **Project Development**: Navigate all stages of project design, from ideation to final deployment.
- **Real-World Applications**: Apply knowledge from previous courses to create functional and impactful projects.
- **Teamwork**: Collaborate effectively with peers to achieve shared goals.
- **Project Management**: Master Agile techniques, Jira, and GitHub for efficient project workflows.
- **Documentation Skills**: Learn to create comprehensive technical documents that reflect industry standards.
- **Literature Review**: Students will learn to conduct a literature search to support their design decisions and to cite sources appropriately.

Your project deliverables will involve writing-intensive components, iterating on feedback to produce high-quality work evaluated using rubrics.

### Expectations for Class Conduct
The best way to maintain a safe and focused learning environment is for everyone to get vaccinated. We all need to follow the university guidance on masking as well. For your general health and well-being, hand washing and monitoring your health is still highly recommended.
It is also important to foster a respectful and productive learning environment that includes all students in our diverse community of learners. Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University's nondiscrimination statement, will add richness to this learning experience. Therefore, all opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse.
Treat your classmates and instructor with respect in all communication, class activities, and meetings. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Please consider that sarcasm, humor and slang can be misconstrued in online interactions and generate unintended disruptions. Profanity should be avoided as should the use of all capital letters when composing responses in discussion threads, which can be construed as “shouting” online. Remember to be careful with your own and others’ privacy. In general, have your behavior mirror how you would like to be treated by others.

### Statement on recording and distribution of recordings of class sessions

Any recordings permitted in this class can only be used for the student’s personal
educational use. Students are not permitted to copy, publish, or redistribute audio or video
recordings of any portion of the class session to individuals who are not students in the
course or academic program without the express permission of the faculty member and
of any students who are recorded. Distribution without permission may be a violation of
educational privacy law, known as FERPA as well as certain copyright laws. Any
recordings made by the instructor or university of this course are the property of Temple
University.

### Academic Freedom

Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom. The
university has adopted a [Policy on Student and Faculty Academic Rights and Responsibilities (links to an external site.)](https://secretary.temple.edu/policies).
http://policies.temple.edu/PDF/99.pdf

### Academic Honesty

According to the University Student Code of Conduct, students must not commit, attempt to
commit, aid, encourage, facilitate, or solicit the commission of academic dishonesty and
impropriety including plagiarism, academic cheating, and selling lecture notes or other information
provided by an instructor without the instructor’s authorization. Violations may result in failing the assignment and/or failing the course, and/or other sanctions as enumerated in the [University Code of Conduct (Links to an external site.)](https://studentconduct.temple.edu/policies).
