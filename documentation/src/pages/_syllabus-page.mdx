## Online classroom etiquette

It is expected that each student attends every class on time for the full duration of each
class and behaves, in the same professional manner, as if you are in a regular classroom.
This refers in particular to your location and attire. It is not appropriate to eat a large meal, be in the midst of commuting or driving a motorized vehicle, drink alcohol, smoke, or getting up often during an online class.


## Course Description

This course is designated as a capstone course by CIS department. By its very nature, it is a method of summative evaluation of students' learned knowledge in computer science. It allows an instructor to assess the student’s overall academic learning experience and its application to software project development. It provides an environment and atmosphere in which students run team-oriented design and implementation of large programming projects. Students will propose topics for review and acceptance early in the semester. Students will provide written documentation of their proposed projects and will demonstrate the operation of their completed projects in oral presentations and demonstrations. General agile-based industrial-standard project management processes for software development will be applied to project development in all phases.
This is a pure “project-driven” course and students work on their assignments in a project
team. Project-driven learning is known as active learning in which in-depth classroom projects are organized to facilitate learning and assess student competence. This means that students will spend a lot of lab time in lab and collaborate with other team members during the project development phases. It is believed that learning takes place best within the context of problems to be solved and questions that are raised. We expect students to provide the solutions to problems arising during the project development, both technically and managerially.
This course is identified as a Writing-Intensive Course in CIS. You are expected to learn about writing relevant technical software design and development documents along the course of your project development and generate all the documents and their revisions in the entire duration of the course.

### Education Goal
The design of this capstone course is to provide senior students in computer science major with a typical industrial working environment in which students will undergo all the project development phases and gain the experience of project development practices. Students apply all the knowledge they learned in their previous years in college and acquire new knowledge and skills needed to complete their projects. At the end of class, students are able to reach the goal of learning to work - making transition from school to work. Project will be proposed, documented, developed and tested step by step. Students working in teams must deliver deliverables in accordance with requirements on schedule within resource restriction. Students are expected to improve their project management, communication and team working skills in all the development phases.

### Learning Objectives

- Learn and improve technical writing skill - Writing-Intensive
- Practice active learning - project driven
- Coordinate working in team and improve communication skill

### Labs

When you register for this course, you are mainly registering for the lab session for this course.
You are expected to spend more time in lab than in lecture. Students are REQUIRED to attend
the lab section that they are registered for.  Attendance will count as part of your grade. Random
attendance record will be checked in both labs and lectures.

The labs are designed for team members to work together and to communicate with each other in a group. Successful project development relies on a teamwork environment in which team members must collaborate and communicate.

### Project

You will undergo all the project development phases and experience the project development
practice in a typical industrial working environment. Project will be proposed, documented,
developed, and tested step by step. The final goals of a project are to deliver deliverables in
accordance with requirements on schedule within resource restriction. You are expected to
improve your project management and team working skills in all the development phases.

Students will be organized into project teams ranging in size from 5 to 7. The project will follow
a modified version of the Rational Unified Process known as the Unified Process for Education.

Students will propose their project ideas at the start of the second week of class. Project ideas must be substantial enough to be completed by
a team of 5 - 7 students.

:::note Project Categories

- Mobile Applications
- Progressive Web Applications
- Embedded Systems
- Machine Learning
- RESTFul APIs
- Message Bot Integrations
- *Multiplayer* Games

Ultimatly **be creative and passionate**. Some projects may not fit the above categories, and that is okay as long as the idea is well thought out, and researched.

:::tip

Check out the [Capstone Hall of Fame](/hall-of-fame) to see previous examples of incredible projects and their demos.

:::

### Project Management Process

Agile-based software development project management process and the deployment of its tools
will be introduced in the class. Agile is a very empowering process that helps software
companies design and build the right products. The management process is very beneficial for
software companies because it helps them analyze and improve their products throughout its
development. Agile is a process that helps teams provide quick and unpredictable responses to
the feedback they receive on their projects. It creates opportunities to assess a project’s direction
during the development cycle. Teams assess the project progresses in regular meetings called
sprints or iterations.

### Documentation

You are expected to develop your documentation using a project documentation tool called
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs). Docusaurus will help you create and maintain a
documentation website for all of your project documents. They will be written in markdown
format. These, then, are easily published to GitHub Pages (for references on the markdown
format we recommend this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). We will
provide templates and tutorials on how to generate and revise your documents. These should be
followed to receive a grade on your documentation assignments.

You will open a pull request on GitHub, marking Instructors as reviewers, and turn in a link to
your project documents on-line to the Canvas Web site. The instructors will directly comment on
your documentation site's GitHub repository, but you will receive your grade through Canvas.
These documents will be continuously revised over the course of the semester in this manner.

### Quizzes and Exams
There will be no mid-term and final exams given for this capstone course. Several milestone project demos and one final project presentations and demo during the semester will be made in lieu of mid-term and final exams. Several quizzes in the format of Zoom Polling may be given as we move forward to project development phases.

### Grading
- 10% Project Proposal
- 40% Project Documents
- 10% Project Management Process
- 30% Project Presentation, Demos and Deliverables
- 10% Attendance and Participation


:::warning **THIS IS A WRITING INTENSIVE COURSE.**
 As a university policy on a writing-intensive course, at least 40% weight will be weighed to the final score in Canvas based on the writing assignments. You will submit all the project documentation and project status reports as writing assignments to Canvas and the work will be graded based on technical content and quality of writing.
:::

There will be two kinds of assignments in this course: group and individual assignments. As a result, your final grading will mainly be dependent on both group performance and your personal performance. First, a project will get a grade based on the group performance. This project grade will be used as a base grade for all the students working in the same project group.

:::tip

Each student's grade is adjusted either up or down based on the student's personal performance in the project and the scores in Canvas (see Figure below).

<Figure src={grading} alt={"The function G(g) set equal to the scale from C+ to A- Ascending on the Y axis. On the X axis are 7 squares representing students, with the second square appearing higher on the y-axis to represent the score of A-. Attached to the afformentioned second square is a curly brace with a delta function with p as an argument to represent performance. on the rightmost side of the image are four male and female stick figures."} caption={"Grading Individual and Group Performance Scale."}
        subcaption={`g = Group performance,
    p = Personal performance,  Final grade = G(g) + Δ(p)`}
/>

If for example, a project gets a group grade B based on the group performance, almost all of the team members in the project team will get B grades except a few team members may get better or poorer grades than B based on their personal performance. Therefore, it is important to contribute, and be a team player.

:::

:::caution Canvas grades are only used as reference
As a result of this grading policy the scores in Canvas will only be used as a reference for providing final grades.
:::


### Group Performance Measurement

The group performance is evaluated in the following three measurements:
- deliverables meeting requirements,
- complexity of project
- teamwork

### Personal Performance Measurement

The personal performance is evaluated in the following three measurements:
- initiative
- contribution
- attitude

:::note GitHub and Jira will be used to measure personal performance.
:::

### Course Orientation

This is a pure “project-driven” course and you work on your assignment in a project in a team. This means that you will spend a lot of lab time in lab and collaborate with other team members during the project development phases. It seems as though learning takes place best within the context of problems to be solved and questions that are raised. We expect you to provide the solutions to problems arising during the project development, both technically and managerially.

### Course Schedule

There are 16 weeks in the semester. The project schedule is managed in three phases as follows:

- Inception (2 weeks): decide what you do
- Elaboration (4 weeks): say how you will do it
- Construction (10 weeks): do what you say in elaboration. Or to quote Nike "Just Do It."

There will be three milestone and one final presentations/demos. All milestone demos are scheduled in the Construction phase and the final demo at the end of the semester. A detailed class schedule is shown below.

:::important Some Activities are subject to change
As instructor I reserve the right to change activities if necessary, however **Milestone demo dates will not change** during the duration of the course. Any changes to schedule will be announced automatically in the class [Discord](#class-discord).

### Class Policies

**Attendance to both lab and lecture is mandatory in this course**, as it is essential for successful project development in a team setting. We will use Qwickly in Canvas to track students’ attendance. Unexcused absences will not only negatively impact your personal performance, but also the performance of your team. As a result, it may result in a reduction of your final grade. Please make every effort to attend all lecture and lab sessions on time. If you are unable to attend a class for any reason, please inform your team members and the instructor ahead of time as a courtesy. During class sessions, please keep your mobile phone on vibrate mode.

:::danger working a fulltime job

Tell your manager that you can't work during this class as it is highly interactive and requires your full attention, particularly when we begin the project. I expect that since you registered for this course, you can fully participate. If you are unable to interact, give presentations, turn on your camera, or communicate with your teammates during lab or lecture, it would be best for you to withdraw from the course.

:::


You are expected to turn in your project documents online to the Canvas Web site on time. Late Assignments are subject to reduced points or a 0 grade. Project Documents must be published using Docusaurus and live on GitHub Pages. Late and hand-written submission will not be accepted or graded. If you submit multiple versions of the document online before the deadline, only the latest version will be graded. This does not apply to the revision of documentation.

You may discuss project assignments with your friends, but everyone must write their own solutions. Additionally, you must include the names of any collaborators on the front page of the assignment or in the comments in the code, e.g. "I discussed this with Peter and Sally."

:::important Using Open Source

Using open source code is allowed and encouraged, but you are responsible for adhering to the open source license agreement if your project implementation includes any open source software code.

:::

Sharing your code, design specifications, and other documents in the capstone project with other students is permitted and encouraged. If you receive help from other students concerning the solution of your project implementation, it is appropriate to acknowledge that help in your design documents or in your source code as comments, e.g. "I discussed this with Peter and Sally." If you copy someone else's code, you must cite the source.

## Appendix

This course is identified as a Writing-Intensive Course in CIS. Students are expected to learn
about writing relevant software development documentation along the course of their project
development and generate all the documentation and their revisions in the entire duration of the
course. This Appendix lists all the documentation that will be generated by individual student or
project team contribution during project phases. It is very important to pay close attention to the
following general and individual requirements of documentation artifacts.

### Documentation by Phase

The documentation is expected to be developed over the life of the project, but certain
documents are required to be initially delivered (I), finalized (F), or revised/updated (R) at the
end of a particular phase as shown in the following table:

| Document                   | Inception | Elaboration | Construction |
|----------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Project Proposal           | F         |             |              |

| Design Document (Part II)  |           | I           | F            |
| Test Procedures            |           | I           | F            |
| Test Report                |           |             | F            |

### General Requirements

Documentation will contain:
-  Title Page: showing the name of the document, authors, release date, and revision
number.
-  Table of Contents (auto generated by Docusaurus)
-  Revision History (generated from commit history)
-  Document overview: summarize the purpose and contents of the document
-  Body: the content of this document
-  References to other documents or publication
-  Glossary if required

Each page will include a page number, document title, release date, and revision number in the
header or footer.

All the figures and tables in your document must have captions accompanied with the figures
and tables. Provide reference list at the end of the document. You must cross-reference the
captions and references in the body of the text in your documents.

### Project Proposal

#### Purpose
The Project Proposal provides an initial description of the project’s goals. It offers:
- a flavor of what the application will accomplish
- why the user should use this application
- why this application and approach are superior to the competition’s efforts

#### Requirements
The Project Proposal will consist of the following.

#### Project Abstract

The Project Abstract will be at least 1/2 page, but not more than one-page long. A page is defined as an 8 1/2" × 11" with 1" margins containing 11-point single-spaced text. The Project Abstract will contain.

- A top-level description of the requirements.
- A conceptual design.
- Reference to similar products.
The abstract will not contain phrases such as:
- We are a team from Temple University ...
- This application fulfills a class requirement ...
- I am doing this because ...
- Our team has decided to ...
Examples can be found on software websites, advertising brochures, and in the introduction section of many manuals. Here is a short example:
TestItAll sets a new standard for automating software testing and development. A series of user defined menus will enable testers to create easily regression suites without the need to learn a proprietary programming language. And on, and on, and on, for at least half a page of text.
Note that the Project Abstract will be placed on the project development web page/wiki, and repeated as the introduction to all other documents associated with the project.
Optional, but strongly suggested, a project logo no more than 32 pixels high and no more than 128 pixels wide.

#### Top Level Requirements

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

#### Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

#### Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed- source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

#### Required Resources
Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.

### Requirements Specification

#### Purpose

This is the very first design document of your project. It serves as a contract between your project team and the project stakeholders. The Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the product. Those requirements will be verified as a measurement of the project success or failure.
Requirements

The requirements specification document should contain the following sections:
- System Overview
- System Block Diagram
- Document Overview
- General Requirements
- Features and Requirements
- Use-case descriptions:
    - For each use-case define the triggering event and the interactions between the actor and the system. Normal and alternate flows should be described. State Diagrams may be useful in some cases.
    - As an alternative to use-cases, user stories may be used, provided they are accompanied by scenarios that can form the basis for acceptance testing.
    - Diagram or some other diagram that identifies the external interfaces. External interfaces include the user and external hardware or software.

### Software Development Plan

#### Purpose

The Software Development Plan describes the activities and tasks to be performed to develop the software product.
Requirements

In addition to the general requirements the Software Development Plan will contain the following sections:
- Activities - requirements gathering, top-level design, detailed design, test.
- Tasks - A task is the performance of an activity leading to a specific feature in a
product. E.G. Design of unit x. Associated with each task is predecessor tasks (what tasks must be complete before this task can start) an estimated effort estimated finish data responsible individual successor tasks (what tasks cannon start until this task is complete)
- Schedule - A graphical layout of the tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. Mark the chart for the milestone demos and decide the features shown in each demo.
- Development Environment - The required hardware and software to be used to develop the project. This includes the selected IDE, compilers, editors, test tools, etc. Map the effort of hardware and software setting up as tasks as well and mark your chart for the completion of such tasks.
- Version Control - The selected version control tool and procedures for maintaining a defined master configuration.

### Design Document (Part I: Architecture Design)

#### Purpose

The Design Document (Architecture) describes the software architecture and how the requirements are mapped into the design. This document will be a combination of diagrams and text that describes what the diagrams are showing.

#### Requirements

In addition to the general requirements the Design Document (Architecture) will contain:

A description the different components and their interfaces. For example: client, server, database.

For each component provide class diagrams showing the classes to be developed (or used) and their relationship.

Sequence diagrams showing the message flow for each use-case (walk the user story through the system block diagram).

State diagrams for classes that have states.

Describe algorithms employed in your project, e.g. neural network paradigm, training and training data set, etc.
If there is a database: Entity-relation diagram.

Table design.

### Design Document (Part II: API Design)

#### Purpose

The Design Document (API) gives the complete design of the software implementation.

#### Requirements

In addition to the general documentation requirements the Design Document will contain:

General review of the software architecture for each module specified in Design Document (Architecture)

For each class define the data fields, methods. The purpose of the class.

The purpose of each data field. The purpose of each method

Pre-conditions if any. Post-conditions if any. Parameters and data types

Return value and output variables Exceptions thrown.

:::note
At the top level, or where appropriate, all exceptions should be caught and an error message that is meaningful to the user generated. It is not OK to say ("xxxx has encountered a problem and will now close (OK?)") Error messages and recovery procedures should be documented in the User’s Manual/README.
:::

This information should be in structured comments (e.g. Javadoc) in the source files. A documentation generation tool (e.g. Javadoc) should be used to generate the document.

### Test Procedures

#### Purpose

The Test Procedures describe the test approach and the tests to be performed to verify the requirements specified in the Requirements Document.

#### Requirements

In addition to the general documentation requirements this document will contain the procedures for the following tests:

- Unit tests
    - For each method, one or more test cases.
    - A test case consists of input parameter values and expected results. All external classes should be stubbed using mock objects.

- Integration tests
    - Tests to demonstrate each use-case based on the use-case descriptions and the sequence diagrams. External input should be provided via mock objects and results verified via mock objects. Integration tests should not require manual entry of data nor require manual interpretation of results.

- Acceptance test
    - Demonstration of all of the functional and non-functional requirements. This can be a combination of automated tests derived from the use-cases (user stories) and manual tests with recorded observation of the results.

### Test Report Purpose

The Test Report is a record that the tests were run and a documentation of their results.

#### Requirements

In addition to the general documentation requirements this document will contain: Output from the unit test runs.

Output from the integration test runs.

Output from automated acceptance tests.

A copy of the manual acceptance test procedures with notations indicating that the test was performed and the observed results.

List of known problems: describe each failed test.

### README.md/User’s Manual

#### Purpose

The User’s Manual describes how to use and maintain the system. It can be presented as two documents, one for the end-user and the other for the maintainer.
Requirements

In addition to the general documentation requirements the User’s Manual will contain
- Quick Start Guide For the experienced user.
- Installation Basic installation, network considerations, uninstalls. Installation should be
automated and seamless. The system must be responsible for determining if minimum requirements are satisfied. For a client/server system this includes installation of both the client and server software. For a mobile application, it includes build and deployment instructions.
- Configuration Single user, multi-user, network, resources. Automation is again the key to successful configuration.
- Security Passwords.
- Database Installation and maintenance if required.
- Application Functions System functionality, screen shots. Step-by-step operating
procedures.
- Backup and Recovery
- Error Messages Messages and actions. Don’t leave people hanging. When an error is
reported, there must be a corrective action.
- Troubleshooting Troubleshoot the application – not the operating system or network.
- Support Contacts, contracts

## Attendance and Your Health

We continue to meet the changing circumstances of the COVID- 19 pandemic with flexibility and by working together as a community. To achieve course learning goals, students must attend and participate in classes, according to the course requirements. However, if you feel unwell or if you are under quarantine or in isolation because you have been exposed to the virus or tested positive for it, you should not come to campus or attend in-person classes or activities. It is the student’s responsibility to contact me to create a plan for participation and engagement in the course as soon as you are able to do so, and to make a plan to complete all assignments in a timely fashion when illness delays your completion.

## Academic Freedom

Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom. The
university has adopted a [Policy on Student and Faculty Academic Rights and Responsibilities (links to an external site.)](https://secretary.temple.edu/policies).

## Academic Honesty

According to the University Student Code of Conduct, students must not commit, attempt to
commit, aid, encourage, facilitate, or solicit the commission of academic dishonesty and
impropriety including plagiarism, academic cheating, and selling lecture notes or other information
provided by an instructor without the instructor’s authorization. Violations may result in failing the assignment and/or failing the course, and/or other sanctions as enumerated in the [University Code of Conduct (Links to an external site.)](https://studentconduct.temple.edu/policies).
