## Description:

This course is designated as a capstone course by CIS department. By its very nature, it is a method of summative evaluation of students' learned knowledge in computer science. It allows an instructor to assess the student’s overall academic learning experience and its application to software project development. It provides an environment and atmospheric in which students run team-oriented design and implementation of large programming projects. Students will propose topics for review and acceptance early in the semester. Students will provide written documentation of their proposed projects and will demonstrate the operation of their completed projects in oral presentations and demonstrations. General agile-based industrial-standard project management processes for software development will be applied to project development in all phases.
This is a pure “project-driven” course and students work on their assignments in a project
team. Project-driven learning is known as active learning in which in-depth classroom projects are organized to facilitate learning and assess student competence. This means that students will spend a lot of lab time in lab and collaborate with other team members during the project development phases. It is believed that learning takes place best within the context of problems to be solved and questions that are raised. We expect students to provide the solutions to problems arising during the project development, both technically and managerially.
This course is identified as a Writing-Intensive Course in CIS. You are expected to learn about writing relevant technical software design and development documents along the course of your project development and generate all the documents and their revisions in the entire duration of the course.

## Education Goal
The design of this capstone course is to provide senior students in computer science major with a typical industrial working environment in which students will undergo all the project development phases and gain the experience of project development practices. Students apply all the knowledge they learned in their previous years in college and acquire new knowledge and skills needed to complete their projects. At the end of class, students are able to reach the goal of learning to work - making transition from school to work. Project will be proposed, documented, developed and tested step by step. Students working in teams must deliver deliverables in accordance with requirements on schedule within resource restriction. Students are expected to improve their project management, communication and team working skills in all the development phases.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn and improve technical writing skill - Writing-Intensive
- Practice active learning – project driven
