# GitHub Statistics

The following are automatically generated charts of all teams Pull Requests, Reviews, and code Commits count. We obtained all of this data from the GitHub API. Make sure to distribute coding amongst your team and submit pull requests for features. All Pull Requests should be formally reviewed on GitHub. Make sure that when you open a pull request that you assign a reviewer and that that reviewer approves the request. Now I understand Pull Requests are not the only metric to evaluate contributions. We can also see statistics on git commits. You can view these statistics live on the GitHub Insights tab on each of your repositories. Only commits to the main branch are counted towards this statistic.

If you are not satisfied with the metrics you see now would be the time to start contributing to your projects. Ask your project leader what you should do. If you have any other questions or concerns about anything concerning GitHub contributions [please reach out to me or my TA](/#contact-professor-applebaum)!
