"SOKROBAN" is a puzzle game based on the 1982 classic game called ‚ÄúSokoban‚Äù, that will challenge users and test their problem-solving skills. The user will have to move a different amount of crates across a procedurally generated map, and place all the crates onto the designated targets in order to complete the puzzle (level). SOKROBAN offers a Normal and a Challenge Mode for the Single Player game play, as well as Co-op and VS mode for head-to-head competition in the Multiplayer Modes.
