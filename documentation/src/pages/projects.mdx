This project aims to enhance the way feedback is given to learners, particularly on resumes, by linking feedback with design principles such as consistency and specificity. It utilizes ChatGPT to create chapters that help learners understand and apply feedback effectively.
### GitHub Copilot Clone for Education
The goal is to develop a GitHub Copilot clone that functions similarly but includes rich logging capabilities to monitor user behavior. This project addresses the problem of novices misusing AI coding assistants by providing educational interventions when mistakes are made.
### AAC Play
This project focuses on enhancing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for children. It aims to integrate games that encourage social interaction while also providing necessary communication tools for AAC users, potentially reducing social isolation.
### Piggyback Learning
The project involves creating tools to make educational YouTube videos more engaging for children. These tools would inject interactive quizzes and learning materials into videos to improve structured learning experiences.
### Procedural Scaffolding
Inspired by the Mechanical Novel framework, this project explores the use of AI agents to replace crowdsourcing workers in creating stories. Different agents can be assigned personalities, akin to famous authors, to evaluate how effectively AI can produce quality written content.
### 3D Printer Security
The project involves developing a security tool for 3D printing systems used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. The goal is to create a "last mile" security solution that scans the manufacturing files either before or as they are being sent to the 3D printer. This tool should detect and prevent malicious activities such as wasting materials, overheating, or damaging the printer through unauthorized commands.
