| **Feedstack**<br/>Stephen MacNeil                     | This project aims to enhance the way feedback is given to learners, particularly on resumes, by linking feedback with design principles such as consistency and specificity. It utilizes ChatGPT to create chapters that help learners understand and apply feedback effectively.                                                                                                                                        |
| **GitHub Copilot Clone for Education**<br/>Stephen MacNeil            | The goal is to develop a GitHub Copilot clone that functions similarly but includes rich logging capabilities to monitor user behavior. This project addresses the problem of novices misusing AI coding assistants by providing educational interventions when mistakes are made.                                                                                                      |
| **AAC Play**<br/>Cindy Zastudil                                       | This project focuses on enhancing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices for children. It aims to integrate games that encourage social interaction while also providing necessary communication tools for AAC users, potentially reducing social isolation.                                                                                                        |
| **Piggyback Learning**<br/>Rahad Arman Nabid                          | The project involves creating tools to make educational YouTube videos more engaging for children. These tools would inject interactive quizzes and learning materials into videos to improve structured learning experiences.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Story Builder Project**<br/>Rahad Arman Nabid                       | This project proposes the use of AI agents to automate story creation. It envisions a system where users can generate agents that create story outlines and chapters, which are then voted on for selection. The process is inspired by crowdsourcing but uses AI agents instead of human writers. The system also allows for user edits and aims to create a full story autonomously. The project draws inspiration from existing research on collaborative writing to develop a new method using AI technology. |
| **3D Printer Security**<br/>Daniel Collins                            | The project involves developing a security tool for 3D printing systems used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. The goal is to create a “last mile” security solution that scans the manufacturing files either before or as they are being sent to the 3D printer. This tool should detect and prevent malicious activities such as wasting materials, overheating, or damaging the printer through unauthorized commands. |
| **Bioinformatics Software Tutorial Supporting Chatbot**<br/>Hannah Kim | This project aims to develop software that uses AI to facilitate learning about bioinformatics. It involves creating a chatbot with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities, which can refer to a database to answer user questions. Key features include a customized tutorial experience, a clean web application interface, chat history, use of a free API key to keep costs low, and the ability to admit when it doesn’t know an answer rather than providing incorrect information. This project highlights the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and overcoming barriers in bioinformatics education. |
