# How to Add Students to Temple Jira Cloud Organization

Adding students to your Jira Cloud organization can be done efficiently by following these steps:

## Access Jira Cloud
Navigate to our Jira Cloud using this link: [Jira Cloud](https://temple-cis-projects-in-cs.atlassian.net/jira).

## Prepare Student Email List
Export the list of student emails. You can obtain this list from platforms such as TUportal or the Canvas grade book. Ensure that the email list is up-to-date and accurate.

## Send Invitation Links
1. Have a TA with admin privileges log into Jira.
2. Go to the administration panel and select the option to "Invite Users."
3. Input the email addresses of the students one by one (unfortunately there is no bulk option).
4. Send invitation links to the students' email addresses.

## Student Account Setup
Upon receiving the invite, students need to:
- Click on the link provided in the email.
- Sign up for a Jira account if they don’t already have one.
- If a student already has a Jira account, they should log in using their existing credentials.

## Communicate Important Details
- Inform students clearly about the email ID they should use to sign up or log in with.
- Highlight the importance of remembering their login credentials and which account they use.

## Troubleshoot Common Issues
- If a student encounters issues such as being unable to sign in or receiving an error about an existing account, they should check if they’re using the correct email.
- Advise students to reset their password if they’ve forgotten it.

By following these steps, you will ensure a smooth onboarding process for students into your Jira Cloud organization, minimizing potential login and account setup issues.
