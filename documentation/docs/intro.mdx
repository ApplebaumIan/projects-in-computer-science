## Why Documentation Matters

Documentation is a critical part of software projects. Think about it. When you're researching the tools you need for your projects, you're more likely to use the one that has documentation and a community that is actively using it. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file, you're likely to just skip it because you don't even know where to start. Large companies also expect you to document your code so that management can add more team members when necessary, and so that 20 years down the road, they can maintain it. For companies and open-source communities alike, documentation ensures:
- Team scalability and onboarding
- Long-term maintainability of the codebase
- Clear communication of the project‚Äôs purpose and functionality

Many modern projects use **Docusaurus**, an open-source tool by Meta, to build and maintain documentation. Docusaurus allows you to write documentation in simple Markdown files located in the `documentation/docs/` directory. If you‚Äôre new to Markdown, it‚Äôs easy to learn!

---

## Assignment Overview

Your task is to create project documentation using Docusaurus and host it publicly on GitHub Pages.

## Quick Markdown Tutorial

</summary>

Markdown is a simple way to format text, and Docusaurus transforms it into a professional-looking website. Here's an example:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

- **Heading 2** (##) appears in the right-hand sidebar as a table of contents.
- **Heading 3** (###) appears as a sub-item under Heading 2.

For advanced Markdown features, visit the [Docusaurus tutorial section](/tutorial/intro) or [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Join GitHub Classroom

1. [Click here to join the GitHub Classroom and get the starter project](https://classroom.github.com/a/B0Pl5Vwl).
2. Log in to your GitHub account or create one at [GitHub](https://github.com).
3. Select your name and TUmail from the list.
4. Join your team or create a new one if none exists.

---

### Step 2: Configure the GitHub Build Environment

**One team member must complete this setup:**

1. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository ‚Üí Enable workflows if prompted.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
- Navigate to the repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**.
- Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
- Select **gh-pages** as the branch and **/ (root)** as the folder.

3. **Deploy the Documentation Website:**
- Make any edit to your repository (e.g., edit the README file) ‚Üí Commit and push the changes to `main`.
- GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site to the `gh-pages` branch using the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

4. **View Your Website:**
- After the workflow completes, navigate to the repository homepage ‚Üí Look for the "github-pages" environment ‚Üí Click "View Deployment."
- Your site will be available at: `https://capstone-projects-YEAR-SEMESTER.github.io/project-PROJECT-NAME/`
  - For example: `https://capstone-projects-2025-spring.github.io/project-acc-hungry-hippos/`

---

### Step 3: Repository Setup

1. Edit the `README.md` file:
- Add a project overview at the top.
2. Lock the `main` branch:
- [Set up branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).

---

## Submission Instructions
