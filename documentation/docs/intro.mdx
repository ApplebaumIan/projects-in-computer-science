## Why Documentation Matters

Documentation is a critical part of software projects. Think about it. When you're researching the tools you need for your projects, you're more likely to use the one that has documentation and a community that is actively using it. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file, you're likely to just skip it because you don't even know where to start. Large companies also expect you to document your code so that management can add more team members when necessary, and so that 20 years down the road, they can maintain it. For companies and open-source communities alike, documentation ensures:
- Team scalability and onboarding
- Long-term maintainability of the codebase
- Clear communication of the project‚Äôs purpose and functionality

Many modern projects use **Docusaurus**, an open-source tool by Meta, to build and maintain documentation. Docusaurus allows you to write documentation in simple Markdown files located in the `documentation/docs/` directory. If you‚Äôre new to Markdown, it‚Äôs easy to learn!

## Quick Markdown Tutorial

Markdown is a simple way to format text, and Docusaurus transforms it into a professional-looking website. Here‚Äôs an example:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

- **Heading 2** (##) appears in the right-hand sidebar as a table of contents.
- **Heading 3** (###) appears as a sub-item under Heading 2.

For advanced Markdown features, visit the [Docusaurus tutorial section](/tutorial/intro) or [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Join GitHub Classroom

1. [Click here to join the GitHub Classroom and get the starter project](https://classroom.github.com/a/B0Pl5Vwl).
2. Log in to your GitHub account or create one at [GitHub](https://github.com).
3. Select your name and TUmail from the list.
4. Join your team or create a new one if none exists.

---

### Step 2: Configure the GitHub Build Environment

**One team member must complete this setup:**

1. Generate a Personal Access Token:
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer Settings** ‚Üí **Personal Access Tokens** ‚Üí **Generate new token**.
- Select these permissions: `repo`, `workflow`, `admin:read:org`.
- Set the expiration date to the course‚Äôs end.
- Copy the token (you won‚Äôt be able to retrieve it later).

2. **Add the Token to the Repository:**
- Navigate to the repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and Variables** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **New Repository Secret**.
- Add the following secrets:
- `TOKEN`: Your personal access token.
- `USER`: Your GitHub username.

3. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
- Go to the **Actions** tab ‚Üí Enable workflows.

4. **Deploy the Documentation Website:**
- Edit the README file ‚Üí Commit and push the changes to `main`.
- GitHub Actions will build and deploy your site.

5. **View Your Website:**
- Navigate to the repository homepage ‚Üí Look for the ‚Äúgithub-pages‚Äù environment ‚Üí Click ‚ÄúView Deployment.‚Äù

---

### Step 3: Repository Setup

1. Edit the `README.md` file:
- Add a project overview at the top.
2. Lock the `main` branch:
- [Set up branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
