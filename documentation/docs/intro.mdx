## Assignment Overview

Your task is to create project documentation using Docusaurus and host it publicly on GitHub Pages.

## Why Docusaurus Instead of Microsoft Word?

You might be wondering: "Why can't I just use Microsoft Word or Google Docs?" Here's why modern software projects use tools like Docusaurus:

**Docusaurus is a lightweight, open-source website builder** that uses React to build comprehensive web pages for your documentation. The best part? **You don't need to know React, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML** to use it.

Key benefits for you:

<div className="benefits-layout">
<div className="benefits-text">

- **Markdown Simplicity**: Just write in markdown (basically text formatting syntax) and get a professional website automatically
- **Version Control Integration**: Documentation lives alongside your code in Git, with effortless versioning through GitHub
- **Zero Setup Required**: Your project already has Docusaurus configured - no installation needed
- **Live Preview**: See your changes instantly while editing with the development server
- **Professional Web Hosting**: Your documentation becomes a searchable, accessible website hosted free on GitHub Pages
- **Permanent URL**: Your documentation URL never changes (unless you rename the project), so you can share it with employers or stakeholders forever
- **Industry Standard**: Most tech companies use similar documentation tools
- **Developer Friendly**: Edit documentation right in your code repository

    <img src="/img/blastpad-example.png"  alt="Blastpad Example" style={{maxWidth:"400px", width: "100%", height: "auto"}} />
</Figure>
</div>
</div>

**GitHub Codespaces Integration**: You can even edit your documentation entirely in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces - no local installation required. You could literally work on this documentation from an iPad!

</div>

The documentation folder is already built into your project repository, and when you write in simple markdown files located in the `documentation/docs/` directory, Docusaurus transforms them into a professional-looking website.

## Why Documentation Matters

Now that you understand the tool, here's why documentation itself is critical for software projects:

When you're researching tools for your projects, you're more likely to use the one that has good documentation and an active community. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file, you probably skip it because you don't know where to start.

Large companies expect you to document your code so that:
- Management can add more team members when necessary
- The codebase can be maintained 20 years down the road
- New developers can onboard quickly
- Knowledge isn't lost when team members leave

For companies and open-source communities alike, documentation ensures:
- Team scalability and onboarding
- Long-term maintainability of the codebase
- Clear communication of the project's purpose and functionality

## Quick Markdown Tutorial

</summary>

Markdown is a simple way to format text, and Docusaurus transforms it into a professional-looking website. Here's an example:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

- **Heading 2** (##) appears in the right-hand sidebar as a table of contents.
- **Heading 3** (###) appears as a sub-item under Heading 2.

### Try It Yourself!

Use the interactive editor below to experiment with markdown syntax:

<MarkdownEditor />

**Common Markdown Syntax:**
- `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, `### Heading 3`
- `**bold text**` and `*italic text*`
- `[link text](url)` for links
- `![alt text](image-url)` for images
- `` `inline code` `` and ` ```language ` for code blocks
- `- item` or `1. item` for lists
- `> text` for blockquotes

For advanced Markdown features, visit the [Docusaurus tutorial section](/tutorial/intro) or [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Join GitHub Classroom

1. [Click here to join the GitHub Classroom and get the starter project](https://classroom.github.com/a/B0Pl5Vwl).
2. Log in to your GitHub account or create one at [GitHub](https://github.com).
3. Select your name and TUmail from the list.
4. Join your team or create a new one if none exists.

---

### Step 2: Configure the GitHub Build Environment

**One team member must complete this setup:**

1. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository ‚Üí Enable workflows if prompted.

2. **Make an initial commit to trigger the workflow:**
- **Each team member should add their name to the `## Collaborators` section in the README.md file** and commit this change.
- This will trigger GitHub Actions to build and deploy your site to the `gh-pages` branch using the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- **Wait for the workflow to complete successfully** (you'll see a green checkmark in the Actions tab).

3. **Enable GitHub Pages (after the workflow completes):**
- Navigate to the repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**.
- Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
- Select **gh-pages** as the branch and **/ (root)** as the folder.
- **Note:** The `gh-pages` branch will only be available after the GitHub Actions workflow has run successfully at least once.

4. **View Your Website:**
- After GitHub Pages is configured, your site will be available at: `https://capstone-projects-YEAR-SEMESTER.github.io/project-PROJECT-NAME/`
  - For example: `https://capstone-projects-2025-spring.github.io/project-acc-hungry-hippos/`

---

### Step 3: Repository Setup

1. **Each team member should make their initial commit:**
   - Add your name to the `## Collaborators` section in the README.md file
   - Commit and push this change as your first contribution to the project

How to Add Yourself as a Collaborator in Git
</summary>

**Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Open `README.md` ‚Üí Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit
3. Find the `## Collaborators` section and add your name
4. Scroll down, add commit message: "Add [Your Name] to collaborators"
5. Click "Commit changes"

**Option 2: Git Command Line**
Clone and navigate to repository
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

Edit README.md (add your name to ## Collaborators section) Then commit your changes
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add [Your Name] to collaborators"
git push origin main
```
