# General Requirements

This section outlines the **technical or operational constraints** that the project must adhere to. These are external constraints on the project, rather than quality attributes of the system itself.

This includes, but is not limited to:

-   **Technology Stack**: Specific technologies, programming languages, or frameworks that must be used.
    -   *Example: "The backend must be developed using Node.js and the Express framework."*
-   **Platform Compatibility**: Compatibility with certain operating systems or hardware.
    -   *Example: "The application must be compatible with Windows 10 and macOS Monterey or later."*
-   **Legal and Regulatory Standards**: Adherence to any legal, industry, or company standards.
    -   *Example: "All user data must be handled in compliance with GDPR."*
