# Requirements Documentation

Once you have setup the GitHub Repo, and submitted the *Team Git Repository Creation* assignment, you will be work on your Requirements Document located in the `documentation/docs/requirements/` directory. This document encapsulates everything that makes up your project. Features, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements. This is the very first design document of your project. It serves as a contract between your project team and the project stakeholders. The Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the product. Those requirements will be verified as a measurement of the project success or failure.


The requirements specification document must include the following sections:

- [**System Overview**](system-overview.md)
- [**System Block Diagram**](system-block-diagram.md)
- [**General Requirements**](general-requirements.md)
- [**Features and Requirements**](features-and-requirements.md)
- [**Use-Case Descriptions**](use-case-descriptions.md)


Revise the Project Proposal document template.
