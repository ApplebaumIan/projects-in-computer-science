You might be wondering: "Why can't I just use Microsoft Word or Google Docs?" Here's why modern software projects use tools like Docusaurus:

Docusaurus is a lightweight, open-source website builder that uses *React* to build comprehensive web pages for your documentation. **You don't need to know React, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML** to use it.

Key benefits for you:

<div className="benefits-text">

- **Markdown Simplicity**: Write in markdown and get a professional website automatically.
- **All-in-One Place**: Your documentation lives right alongside your source code in Git, making it easy to update and version together.
- **Zero Setup & Live Preview**: Docusaurus is already configuredâ€”just edit and see changes instantly with the development server.
- **Professional Hosting**: Your docs become a searchable, accessible website hosted free on GitHub Pages, with a permanent URL you can share.
- **GitHub Codespaces Integration**: You can even edit your documentation entirely in the cloud using GitHub Codespaces - no local installation required. You could literally work on this documentation from an iPad!

## Why Documentation Matters

Now that you understand the tool, here's why documentation itself is critical for software projects:

When you're researching tools for your projects, you're more likely to use the one that has good documentation and an active community. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file, you probably skip it because you don't know where to start.

Large companies expect you to document your code so that:
- Management can add more team members when necessary
- The codebase can be maintained 20 years down the road
- New developers can onboard quickly
- Knowledge isn't lost when team members leave

For companies and open-source communities alike, documentation ensures:
- Team scalability and onboarding
- Long-term maintainability of the codebase
- Clear communication of the project's purpose and functionality
