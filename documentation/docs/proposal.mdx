# Project Proposal

## Purpose
The Project Proposal provides an initial description of the project’s goals. It offers:
- a flavor of what the application will accomplish
- why the user should use this application
- why this application and approach are superior to the competition’s efforts

## Requirements
The Project Proposal will consist of the following.

### Project Abstract

The Project Abstract will be at least 1/2 page, but not more than one-page long. A page is defined as an 8 1/2" × 11" with 1" margins containing 11-point single-spaced text. The Project Abstract will contain.

- A top-level description of the requirements.
- A conceptual design.
- Reference to similar products.

The abstract will not contain phrases such as:

- We are a team from Temple University ...
- This application fulfills a class requirement ...
- I am doing this because ...
- Our team has decided to ...

:::tip
Examples can be found on software websites, advertising brochures, and in the introduction section of many manuals.

Here is a short example:

    TestItAll sets a new standard for automating software testing and development. A series of user defined menus will enable testers to create easily regression suites without the need to learn a proprietary programming language. And on, and on, and on, for at least half a page of text.

:::

:::note
Project Abstract will be placed on the project development web page/wiki, and repeated as the introduction to all other documents associated with the project.
Optional, but strongly suggested, a project logo no more than 32 pixels high and no more than 128 pixels wide.

### Top Level Requirements

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

### Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

### Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed- source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

### Required Resources
Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
