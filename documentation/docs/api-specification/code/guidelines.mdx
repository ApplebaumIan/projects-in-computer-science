# Guidelines for Internal Code Contracts

This page describes the template you should use when documenting classes and modules.

For each class document the following:

- Purpose of the class (one-line summary).
- Data fields: name, type, purpose, visibility (public/private), and invariants.
- Methods: name, signature (parameters + types), return type, purpose, side-effects.
- Preconditions: what must be true for callers.
- Postconditions: guarantees after the method returns.
- Exceptions: which exceptions may be thrown and when (see exceptions page for policies).
- Examples: short code snippets showing typical usage.

Template (copy into your class docs):

``````
Class: ExampleClass
Purpose: Short description.
Fields:
  - name: type — purpose (visibility, invariants)
Methods:
  - doWork(param: Type): ResultType — description
    Preconditions: ...
    Postconditions: ...
    Throws: ExampleException when ...
    Example:
    ```java
    ExampleClass e = new ExampleClass(...);
    e.doWork(...);
    ```
``````
