# Step-by-step: Export Javadocs and host in Docusaurus

This is a cleaned, easy-to-follow version of the walkthrough.

Checklist

- Export Javadoc from IntelliJ
- Put the generated Javadoc into the Docusaurus `static/` folder (or a subfolder)
- Link to the Javadoc from an MDX doc and make the link open in a new tab
- Commit and push

1) Export Javadoc from IntelliJ

- In IntelliJ: Tools → Generate JavaDoc...
- Scope: choose the project or a specific module
- Visibility: choose the level you want exposed (public, protected, package, private)
- Output directory: point to a folder inside your project. Example: `<project-root>/documentation/static/javadoc`
- Generate the docs

2) Add Javadoc to Docusaurus

- Place the entire generated folder under `documentation/static/javadoc/`.
  Files placed in `static/` are served verbatim at the site root when the site is built.
  For example: documentation/static/javadoc/index.html will be available at `/javadoc/index.html`.

3) Link from an MDX page

- Create a docs page (MDX) where you want to reference the Javadoc.
- Use an anchor with target="_blank" to avoid Docusaurus router intercepting the link. Example:

```mdx
<a href="/javadoc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Javadoc</a>
```

4) Commit and deploy

- Add the static files and your MDX doc to git and push. The static assets will be deployed with the site.

Tips

- If you don't see your static files when running the dev server, try restarting the dev server or run `yarn start` from the `documentation` folder.
- Keep generated docs in a separate folder (eg: `documentation/static/javadoc/`) so they don't clutter source.
