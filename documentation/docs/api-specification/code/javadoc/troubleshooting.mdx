# Troubleshooting & Tips

Common issues and how to fix them.

:::note question
## My generated Javadoc isn't visible in the dev site or 404s when I click the link.

- The Docusaurus dev server caches static files. Restart the dev server (`yarn start` from `documentation/`) after adding files to `static/`.
- Ensure the path is correct: a file at `documentation/static/javadoc/index.html` is served at `/javadoc/index.html`.
- Use an anchor with target="_blank" to bypass the client-side router.
:::
:::note question
## Links in the Javadoc point to local file system paths or don't work.

- The Javadoc generator may create relative links that assume a certain base path. If links are broken, ensure all assets (CSS/JS) are in the same structure under `static/`.
- If necessary, adjust the Javadoc `-link` or `-linkoffline` options when generating to make cross-links correct.

:::note question
## I want to include only public APIs, not private/internal classes.

- Set visibility in the IDE generation dialog to `public` or `protected` instead of `private`.
:::
:::note question
## The Javadoc index is being routed by Docusaurus and the page renders as 404.

- Always add `target="_blank"` on the anchor to open the generated HTML in a new browser tab, which avoids the router.
:::
:::note question
## I want to automate the generation and deployment.

- Create a script that runs the javadoc tool and copies the output into `documentation/static/javadoc/`. Run it as part of your CI before the site build.
:::

:::note question
## Build size concerns — Javadoc can be large.

- Consider publishing the Javadoc as a separate static site (GitHub Pages on a different repo or gh-pages branch) and link to it, or archive old versions to keep build sizes small.
