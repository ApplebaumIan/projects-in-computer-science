# HTTP API Contract (OpenAPI)

Your team must define and maintain a complete OpenAPI specification that describes your system’s external REST interface.

This document is the formal contract between your backend and any external client.

## What You Must Produce

Your OpenAPI specification must:

- Define all implemented endpoints
- Include request and response schemas
- Include error responses
- Declare authentication mechanisms
- Include meaningful operation summaries and descriptions

The specification must always reflect the current implementation. If the API changes, the contract must change.
