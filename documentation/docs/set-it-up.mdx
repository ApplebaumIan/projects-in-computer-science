Click the button below to join GitHub Classroom and create your team.

<div className={"col button_group"}>

        className="button button--primary button--outline button--lg"
        to={githubClassroomLink}>
        <div>Create GitHub Team üêô</div>
    </Link>
</div>

### Step 1: Join GitHub Classroom


1. <a href={githubClassroomLink}>Click here to join the GitHub Classroom and get the starter project</a>.
2. Log in to your GitHub account or create one at [GitHub](https://github.com).
3. Select your name and TUmail from the list.
4. Join your team or create a new one if none exists.

### Step 2: Configure the GitHub Build Environment

**One team member must complete this setup:**

1. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository ‚Üí Enable workflows if prompted.

2. **Make an initial commit to trigger the workflow:**
- **Each team member should add their name to the `## Collaborators` section in the README.md file** and commit this change.
- This will trigger GitHub Actions to build and deploy your site to the `gh-pages` branch using the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- **Wait for the workflow to complete successfully** (you'll see a green checkmark in the Actions tab).

3. **Enable GitHub Pages (after the workflow completes):**
- Navigate to the repository ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**.
- Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
- Select **gh-pages** as the branch and **/ (root)** as the folder.
- **Note:** The `gh-pages` branch will only be available after the GitHub Actions workflow has run successfully at least once.

4. **View Your Website:**
- After GitHub Pages is configured, your site will be available at: `https://capstone-projects-YEAR-SEMESTER.github.io/project-PROJECT-NAME/`
  - For example: `https://capstone-projects-2025-spring.github.io/project-acc-hungry-hippos/`

### Step 3: Repository Setup
