# University Policies

## Students with Disabilities

:::note
Please bear in mind that COVID-19 may result in a need for new or additional accommodations.
:::

Any student who has a need for accommodations based on the impact of a documented disability or medical condition should contact Disability Resources and Services (DRS) located in the Howard Gittis Student Center South, 4th Floor at drs@temple.edu or 215-204-1280 to request accommodations and learn more about the resources available to you. If you have a DRS accommodation letter to share with me, or you would like to discuss your accommodations, please contact me as soon as practical. I will work with you and with DRS to coordinate reasonable accommodations for all students with documented disabilities. All discussions related to **your accommodations will be confidential**.

## Student Support Services

The following academic support services are available to students:

- [Student Success Center](https://studentsuccess.temple.edu/)

If you are experiencing food insecurity or financial struggles, Temple provides resources and

Student Aid Program are in operation as well as a variety of resources from the Division of
Student Affairs.

## Attendance and Your Health

We continue to meet the changing circumstances of the COVID- 19 pandemic with flexibility and by working together as a community. To achieve course learning goals, students must attend and participate in classes, according to the course requirements. However, if you feel unwell or if you are under quarantine or in isolation because you have been exposed to the virus or tested positive for it, you should not come to campus or attend in-person classes or activities. It is the student's responsibility to contact me to create a plan for participation and engagement in the course as soon as you are able to do so, and to make a plan to complete all assignments in a timely fashion when illness delays your completion.

## Expectations for Class Conduct

The best way to maintain a safe and focused learning environment is for everyone to get vaccinated. We all need to follow the university guidance on masking as well. For your general health and well-being, hand washing and monitoring your health is still highly recommended.

It is also important to foster a respectful and productive learning environment that includes all students in our diverse community of learners. Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University's nondiscrimination statement, will add richness to this learning experience. Therefore, all opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse.

Treat your classmates and instructor with respect in all communication, class activities, and meetings. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Please consider that sarcasm, humor and slang can be misconstrued in online interactions and generate unintended disruptions. Profanity should be avoided as should the use of all capital letters when composing responses in discussion threads, which can be construed as "shouting" online. Remember to be careful with your own and others' privacy. In general, have your behavior mirror how you would like to be treated by others.

## Recording and Distribution Policy

Any recordings permitted in this class can only be used for the student's personal
educational use. Students are not permitted to copy, publish, or redistribute audio or video
recordings of any portion of the class session to individuals who are not students in the
course or academic program without the express permission of the faculty member and
of any students who are recorded. Distribution without permission may be a violation of
educational privacy law, known as FERPA as well as certain copyright laws. Any
recordings made by the instructor or university of this course are the property of Temple
University.

## Academic Freedom

Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic freedom. The
university has adopted a [Policy on Student and Faculty Academic Rights and Responsibilities](https://secretary.temple.edu/policies).

## Academic Honesty

According to the University Student Code of Conduct, students must not commit, attempt to
commit, aid, encourage, facilitate, or solicit the commission of academic dishonesty and
impropriety including plagiarism, academic cheating, and selling lecture notes or other information
provided by an instructor without the instructor's authorization. Violations may result in failing the assignment and/or failing the course, and/or other sanctions as enumerated in the [University Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.temple.edu/policies).

## Online Web Meeting Tool

Online lectures will be conducted via **Zoom web conferencing**.
Zoom is a web conferencing tool available to all students, faculty and staff. It is used in all lectures
and labs. You can use this tool to meet with your team members or peers.
To access Zoom, login to TUportal and select Zoom from the left navigation menu or go directly
to temple.zoom.us. ZOOM training is provided by CAT. Zoom allows to share screens, slides,
whiteboard, mobile devices and remote desktop controls.

<Admonition type="note">
Hardwired network connections are more consistent than Wi-Fi for Zoom sessions. If
your network speeds are below the suggested rates, please try to move your
computer closer to the Wi-Fi router or try to hardwire your connection.
