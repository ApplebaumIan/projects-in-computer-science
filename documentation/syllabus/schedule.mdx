    <Admonition type="warning" title="Summer Session">
Due to the condensed nature of the summer session, this course is going to be much more intense. <strong>Lectures will be pre-recorded and uploaded to Panopoto</strong> and available on Canvas. All synchronous class sessions will be considered working and meeting times for your teams. Please make sure to keep up with these lectures and be very active and present in the classroom with your teams. There's going to be very little wiggle room. Your success will be primarily measured in your participation in your project and team. <a href="#class-motto">Please refer to the course motto!</a>
