# Course Schedule (Overview)

## How the Semester Is Structured

This course follows an Agile, sprint-based structure modeled after real-world software teams.
While specific lecture topics may shift based on project needs, sprint goals and milestone expectations remain consistent throughout the semester.

- The semester is divided into **six sprints**
- Early sprints (0-2) emphasize **problem understanding and documentation**
- Later sprints (3-6) emphasize **development, iteration, and delivery**
- Stakeholder feedback is incorporated throughout the process

For more details on sprint activities, see the [Sprints & Milestones](./sprints) section of the syllabus.
