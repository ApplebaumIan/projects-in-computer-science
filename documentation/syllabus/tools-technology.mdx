[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a lightweight, open-source website builder that transforms your project documentation into professional-grade websites. **The best part? You don't need to know React, JavaScript, CSS, or HTML** to create comprehensive documentation.

### Why Docusaurus Instead of Microsoft Word?

Modern software projects require documentation that can:
- **Live alongside your code** in Git for seamless version control
- **Support collaborative editing** without file conflicts
- **Deploy automatically** to create searchable, accessible websites
- **Integrate with professional workflows** used by tech companies worldwide

### Your Documentation Portfolio

<div className="blastpad-example-figure" style={{float:"right", marginTop:"5px", marginRight:"15px", marginBottom:"5px"}}>
    <Figure
        id="blastpad-example-syllabus"
        caption={
            <a href="https://capstone-projects-2024-spring.github.io/project-blastpad/">
                <p>Project BlastPad Spring 2024</p>
            </a>
        }
        subcaption={
            <p>Example of a previous capstone project&#39;s <br/> Docusaurus-powered documentation site</p>
        }

        <img
            src="/img/blastpad-example.png"
            alt="Blastpad Example"
            style={{marginTop:"5px", marginLeft:"15px", marginBottom:"5px", maxWidth:"400px", width:"100%"}}
        />

Using basic Markdown syntax, you'll create and maintain the four core technical documents outlined above. These documents mirror industry standards and provide you with real-world experience in professional technical writing.

### Professional Development Experience

Your Docusaurus site will be:
- **Automatically deployed** via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages
- **Permanently accessible** at a stable URL you can share with employers
- **Version-controlled** with complete revision history
- **Professionally formatted** without wrestling with document formatting

The custom course template simplifies setup, and GitHub Actions automate deployment, giving you real-world experience with modern documentation tools used at companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Netflix.
