# Education Technology

Education Technology (Ed Tech) focuses on how digital tools support learning, teaching, and assessment in real-world educational contexts. This domain includes technologies used in classrooms, online learning environments, and informal learning settings, spanning K–12, higher education, and professional training.

Educational technologies shape how learners engage with content, how instructors provide feedback, and how institutions scale instruction while maintaining quality and equity. As these systems become more embedded in everyday learning, design decisions have significant implications for accessibility, trust, motivation, and learning outcomes.

Recent advances—including AI-powered tools—have expanded what educational systems can do, but they also introduce new challenges. Learners may struggle to interpret automated feedback, instructors may lack transparency into system behavior, and institutions must balance efficiency with meaningful learning experiences. Addressing these tensions is central to work in this domain.

Students in this section will design and build technologies that support learning processes rather than replace them. Projects emphasize thoughtful interaction design, real classroom constraints, and evidence-based decision-making to ensure tools meaningfully support learners and educators.

:::note Examples of Previous Education Technology Projects
Projects in this domain prioritize learning goals, classroom realities, and educational impact over specific technologies. Teams choose tools and platforms that best support learners, instructors, and institutional contexts.

      Rahad’s research focuses on human–AI collaboration in educational settings, with an emphasis on how students
      interact with generative AI tools while learning to program. His work investigates how interface design and
      pedagogical scaffolding can help students reason about AI-generated suggestions, calibrate trust, and develop
      deeper conceptual understanding rather than relying on AI output at face value.

        Ian has been teaching at Temple University since 2022, and previously worked at Electric Bluefish Productions Inc. as a software developer working with clients in Epoxy Technology, Agriculture, and Pharmaceutical domains. He is now a researcher in the Temple HCI Lab focusing on educational technology, human-AI interaction, and accessibility. Specifically, the effects Generative AI has on learning, and students’ reliance on these tools. He enjoys sailing and hacking on various side projects in his free time. He's also the instructor of this course and wants you to do well.
