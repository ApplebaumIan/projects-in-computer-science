# Education Technology

Education Technology (Ed Tech) explores how digital tools shape learning, teaching, and assessment in real classroom contexts. In recent years, **Generative AI has fundamentally transformed the way students learn and instructors teach** across many courses. Tools such as **ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor** are now commonly used to support problem solving, programming, and content generation. While these tools can significantly improve productivity and help students solve problems faster, they also introduce new challenges for learning.

In particular, students may come to rely on AI-generated outputs without fully understanding the underlying concepts, leading to shallow learning, overconfidence, or misplaced trust in “black box” systems. Addressing this tension—between productivity and learning—is a central challenge for modern Ed Tech.

My focus in this domain is to **design, develop, and empirically test generative AI–powered learning tools** that support students’ understanding rather than replacing it. These projects emphasize interaction designs that help students reflect on their intent, interpret AI output, and critically evaluate suggestions instead of accepting them blindly.

:::note Examples of Previous Education Technology Projects
Projects in this domain prioritize learning goals, classroom realities, and educational impact over specific technologies. Teams choose tools and platforms that best support learners, instructors, and institutional contexts.

      Rahad’s research focuses on human–AI collaboration in educational settings, with an emphasis on how students
      interact with generative AI tools while learning to program. His work investigates how interface design and
      pedagogical scaffolding can help students reason about AI-generated suggestions, calibrate trust, and develop
      deeper conceptual understanding rather than relying on AI output at face value.
