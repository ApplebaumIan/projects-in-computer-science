# Authentic Capstone Projects

This semester, you’ll experience an authentic capstone projects by integrating real-world research problems. The goal is to focus on the software engineering aspects of developing these systems, rather than conducting research or learning research methods. External stakeholders will act as feedback providers and navigators of requirements, similar to clients in a professional setting. See the [project themes](#project-themes) section for details, topics, and stakeholders. These “resume-worthy” projects will give you hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle, preparing you for the industry. 

:::info These are Real Projects
These real systems will be used by actual users. Your work will have a tangible impact and provide experience in dealing with real-world constraints and requirements. This is a great opportunity to differentiate your portfolio and showcase your skills. It’ll help you **stand out in the job market** more than having multiplayer tetris as your senior project.
