# Authentic Capstone Projects

:::info You are not just *doing a school project.*
You are stepping into a real domain, working with real stakeholders, and building software the way industry expects.
:::

This semester, you will practice:
- Understanding unfamiliar problem domains
- Translating stakeholder needs into software requirements
- Working with constraints that aren’t technical
- Communicating design decisions like a professional engineer

This semester, you’ll experience an authentic capstone projects by integrating real-world research problems. You will experience what it is actually like to be contract software developer, diving into possibly unfamiliar domains and building software that understands them. Your team will focus on the software engineering aspects of developing these systems, rather than conducting research or learning research methods. External stakeholders will act as feedback providers and navigators of requirements, similar to clients in a professional setting. See the [project themes](#project-themes) section for details, topics, and stakeholders. These “resume-worthy” projects will give you hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle, preparing you for the industry.

This is a great opportunity to differentiate your portfolio and showcase your skills. It’ll help you **stand out in the job market** more than having multiplayer tetris as your senior project.)
