# Course Policies
These course policies define the expectations, responsibilities, and professional
standards for CIS 4398. They are designed to mirror industry norms and to support
effective collaboration in a team-based capstone environment.

These policies apply in addition to Temple University policies listed on the next page.
## Assignments
You are expected to turn in your project documents online to the Canvas Web site on time. Late Assignments are subject to reduced points or a 0 grade. Project Documents must be published using Docusaurus and live on GitHub Pages. Late and hand-written submission will not be accepted or graded. If you submit multiple versions of the document online before the deadline, only the latest version will be graded. This does not apply to the revision of documentation.

You may discuss project assignments with your friends, but everyone must write their own solutions. Additionally, you must include the names of any collaborators on the front page of the assignment or in the comments in the code, e.g. "I discussed this with Peter and Sally."
## Open Source
:::important Using Open Source

Using open source code is allowed and encouraged, but you are responsible for adhering to the open source license agreement if your project implementation includes any open source software code.

:::

Sharing your code, design specifications, and other documents in the capstone project with other students is permitted and encouraged. If you receive help from other students concerning the solution of your project implementation, it is appropriate to acknowledge that help in your design documents or in your source code as comments, e.g. "I discussed this with Peter and Sally." If you copy someone else's code, you must cite the source.

## AI Usage
:::important Generative AI/ML models
You may use generative large language models such as ChatGPT in the process of coding your projects. Keep in mind the consequences of using such tools as they have a large impact on your projects quality. Also keep in mind that a large language model is not going to be efficient to develop an entire system. There is no free lunch. These tools are better suited as an aid to your learning.

:::danger Using AI for Documentation
You may not use AI such as ChatGPT to write your documentation for you. You may use it as an aid to your writing, but use of such technology will be considered academic dishonesty.

## Attendance
**Attendance to both lab and lecture is mandatory in this course**, as it is essential for successful project development in a team setting. We will use Qwickly in Canvas to track students’ attendance. Unexcused absences will not only negatively impact your personal performance, but also the performance of your team. As a result, it may result in a reduction of your final grade. Please make every effort to attend all lecture and lab sessions on time. If you are unable to attend a class for any reason, please inform your team members and the instructor ahead of time as a courtesy. During class sessions, please keep your mobile phone on vibrate mode.

:::danger working a fulltime job

Tell your manager that you can't work during this class as it is highly interactive and requires your full attention, particularly when we begin the project. I expect that since you registered for this course, you can fully participate. If you are unable to interact, give presentations, turn on your camera, or communicate with your teammates during lab or lecture, this course may not be a good fit at this time.

:::note
## Online & In person Classroom etiquette

It is expected that each student attends every class on time for the full duration of each
class and behaves, in the same professional manner, as if you are in a regular classroom.
This refers in particular to your location and attire. It is not appropriate to eat a large meal, be in the midst of commuting or driving a motorized vehicle, drink alcohol, smoke, or getting up often during an online class.

These policies are subject to adjustment with notice as required by project needs or institutional guidance.
