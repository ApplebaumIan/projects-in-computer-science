# Agile Sprint Breakdown and Phases

## Phase 1: Documentation & MVP Development (Sprints 0–2)

**Primary Goal:**
Primary Goal: Establish a shared understanding of the problem domain and deliver a documented, testable MVP.

### Sprint 0 — Project Framing & Setup
- Stakeholder onboarding
- Team norms and working agreements
- Problem domain exploration
- Event storming
- Team formation and tooling setup

### Sprint 1 — Requirements & Design
- Requirements gathering and validation
- Initial system design (UML, architecture)
- Formal project documentation (requirements, architecture, rationale)
- MVP planning

:::tip When to Start Development
While early sprints focus on documentation, teams are encouraged to begin prototyping and experimenting with technologies as soon as possible to inform design decisions.
:::

### Sprint 2 — MVP Implementation
- MVP development
- Early testing and validation
- Stakeholder feedback
- Documentation refinement

📌 **By the end of Sprint 2, teams should have a documented system and a working MVP.**

## Phase 2: Development, Refinement & Delivery (Sprints 3–6)

**Primary Goal:**
Iteratively build, refine, and harden the system based on stakeholder feedback.

### Sprints 3–4 — Core Feature Development
This phase focuses on turning your MVP into a robust system through iterative development and stakeholder feedback.

- Major feature implementation
- API development
- Integration work
- Regular stakeholder demos

### Sprints 5–6 — Refinement & Delivery
- Testing and validation
- Performance and usability improvements
- Final documentation
- Presentation and delivery preparation

📌 **By the end of Sprint 6, teams should have a polished, deployable system with complete documentation.**

## Milestone Demos & Deliverables
Milestone Demos occur at the end of Sprints 3, 4, 5, and 6 to showcase progress to stakeholders and gather feedback.
Teams should plan deliverables accordingly to ensure readiness for these demos.
