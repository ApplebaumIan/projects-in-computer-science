As a writing-intensive course, your ability to document and communicate technical ideas is crucial. You'll use Docusaurus, a modern documentation tool, to organize and present your work. Feedback will be provided via Jira tickets to mirror professional feedback processes. You will:

- Submit initial drafts of your documentation.
- Receive detailed feedback to guide revisions.
- Resubmit improved versions for final grading.

### Key Documentation Deliverables

1. **Project Proposal**: Define your project goals, user benefits, and requirements.
2. **Requirements Specification**: Detail your project's features and success criteria.
3. **Design Documents**: Create architecture and API documentation with diagrams.
4. **Test Procedures**: Document your testing strategies and outcomes.

## Tracking Revisions and Feedback

:::tip All Documents can be resubmitted!
You will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit your documents based on feedback. This iterative process is designed to enhance your writing skills and ensure clarity and professionalism in your documentation.
:::
:::warning Feedback Turnaround Time
Please note that resubmissions must be made before the final deadline specified in the syllabus. Additionally, feedback is a valuable thing, please do not beg for it from teaching assistants or instructors. Email the TA or instructor if you have not received feedback within two weeks of submission. For resubmissions please make sure to be clear what it is that needs to be reevaluated and summarize the changes that you made to address it.
:::

Your documentation will be tracked on GitHub, providing clear visibility into changes. A "Revisions" button on your Docusaurus site links to GitHub diffs, making it easy for you to review updates and for instructors to provide feedback.

Feedback will be submitted as Jira tickets, allowing you to engage with comments and integrate them into your workflow. This approach ensures transparency and mirrors industry practices.
